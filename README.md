____

:tada: This is where I will be keeping my notes for the 1st phase of Google's Scholarship program that I was selected for through Udacity. :tada:

### Bertelsmann Scholarship - Introduction to AI in Business Nanodegree Program

I hope to be one of the few selected to receive the full scholarship to the AI Product Manager Nanodegree! 

#### Overview: 

1. Welcome to the AI in Business Scholarship 
2. Introduction to AI in Business 
3. Creating a Dataset 
4. Build a Model 
5. Measuring Impact and updating Models

##### Introduction to AI in Business
First, we'll start by teaching you about the foundations of AI and machine learning: where is it used in industry and how do these technologies work? This section will discuss the type of data you need to create an AI product, the business cases that stand to benefit the most from AI-medicated technology, and the qualities of a good AI product team.

##### Creating a Dataset
In this section, you'll learn how to create your own, novel dataset using Figure Eight's data annotation platform. Data annotation is all about structuring your data such that a machine learning model can learn to automatically find patterns within that data. Here, you'll learn the best design practices for creating a dataset of your own.

*Optional Project: Create a Medical Image Annotation Job*
##### Build a Model
In this section, you'll see how to build and train and end-to-end deep learning model to recognize patterns in a medical image dataset. You'll look at metrics that define the success of your trained model and parameters that affect how it trains.
*Optional Project: Build a Model*

##### Measuring Business Impact
In this final section, you'll learn how to measure the efficacy of your model after it is released. This section discusses methods for identifying bias, updating a model in response to underlying changes in the data, and end-to-end case studies that demonstrate how AI products are ever improving and evolving.

*Optional Project: Capstone Proposal*
