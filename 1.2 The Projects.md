# The Projects

___

### Project 1: Create a Medical Image Annotation Job

In this project, I will design a data annotation job for a dataset of chest xray images; some of which contain signs of pneumonia. The goal, as a product owner is to build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia. As such, this project is designed to test your ability to build a labeled dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images.

### Project 2: Build a Model

In this project, I will take the next step and build a complete classification model that would serve as the backbone for a medical image classification product. **(No coding involved!)** For this task, I will use **Google AutoML**, an automated machine learning tool that will allow you to build the model and host it in the cloud. You'll measure the performance of multiple different models and evaluate them.

### Project 3: Create an AI Product Business Proposal 

In this project, I will put everything together in this final project; develop a complete business proposal for an AI product. The proposal will think through data considerations, evaluation metrics for a trained model, and design best practices for developing an AI product.
This project is meant to test my ability to apply what I've learned throughout this course.
